The `graphql-server-express` package is now called [`apollo-server-express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-express).  The new Apollo Server has many improvements, and we highly recommend moving away from this package.  This package will remain for compatibility reasons but is **not receiving updates**.
